# San-Diego-Trail-Management
This project creates an interactive GIS tool with Python that shows which agencies manage hiking trail segments across San Diego County. Trail data from OpenStreetMap is spatially joined with land ownership data to reveal how trails cross federal, state, local, and non-profit lands.
